# Homework 05: Factor and figure management - Shuxian Fan

This is the GitHub depository of Shuxian Fan for the [homework05](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw05/hw05.html) of STAT545A.

The goals of this homework are:

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

* Write some data to file and load it back into R.

* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.

* Make a plotly visual.

* Implement visualization design principles.
